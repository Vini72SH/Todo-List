# Todo-List

Implementation of a to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Code modularization, object orientation, and local data storage.

This project aims to strengthen my web development skills.
The challenge is to develop a website that stores a to-do list and separates it into different groups. The goal is to create modular code, respecting object orientation and using tools that are commonly used in development, such as npm.
